this is my first test file
This is my first git-git hub experience and it has proven to be a challenge.  For a two-credit course I am spending quite a bit of time on it.  That’s good.  I want to ease my way back into taking classes and the e-portfolio course is a good way of doing that.  
I have been at my current place of employment for seventeen years.  And often time I have felt like a second-class citizen because I do not have a four-year degree.  I had my choice when I was seventeen years old to go with my boyfriend to Florida instead of starting college.  The Portland School of Art had accepted me, I had paid my tuition fee and was awarded a scholarship.
When I was twenty-four I found myself at New Hampshire Community Technical College.  I enrolled and was receiving guidance at the Learning Center.  I was fresh out of a bad break up with the father of my two sons.  This split also included the bakery that I had devoted eight years of sweat (not sweet) equity to.  I was an emotional mess.  The support I received at NHCTC was tremendous.  I worked hard to get myself college ready and it took me three years to complete my Associates Degree in Computer Technology.  
Why I say I feel like a second-class citizen is based on my confidence level and the fact that everything about me is non-traditional.  I know I am on fresh journey right now and finding out that coding is hard is no surprise.  I am grateful for the challenge and will work hard to get myself back into the swing of it.   
When I first started working with GitHub I was doing it in the command prompt and want to continue to do that – so I can pose as a developer.  I switched over the GWI environment to complete this reflection.  This was because I entered a command in the gitbash and my computer starting running code and would not stop, I can’t even remember what command I had typed.  That was scary.  I took a break and went back to the windows environment I have become so accustomed to.
